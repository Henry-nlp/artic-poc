ARTIC
=====

Artic is metadata extractor from Scientific Papers using two-layer CRF.
The current state of the project is not ready to be used.
We have open-source this project with the intent to be used by anyone that wants to have
a better understanding of what is being developed.

Currently, we are working on supporting this project as a tool and make it available as
the version 1.0.

Naturally, we will introduce some changes with the goal
of reducing the size of the project and make it more functional.

This is a Master project developed at the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home).
